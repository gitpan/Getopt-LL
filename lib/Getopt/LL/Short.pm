= NAME

Getopt::LL::Short - Abbreviated Getopt::LL rules.

= VERSION

This document describes Getopt::LL version %%VERSION%%

= SYNOPSIS

    use Getopt:LL::Short qw(getoptions);

    my $options = getoptions([
        '-t=s',             # a string
        '--use-foo=f',      # a flag
        '--verbose|-v',     # also a flag
        '--debug=d|-d',     # a digit
    });

= DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of Getopt::LL that allows for abbreviated rules.

= SUBROUTINES/METHODS


== CONSTRUCTOR

== CLASS METHODS 

=== {getoptions(\@rules, \%options, \@opt_argv)}

Parses and gets arguments based on the rules in \@rules.
Uses @ARGV if \@opt_arg is not specified.

Returns hash with the arguments it found.
@ARGV is replaced with the arguments that does not start with '-' or '--'.

=== {parse_short_rule($rule)}

Each abbreviated rule is sent to this function to convert them into
normal Getopt::LL rules. i.e:
    '--filename=s'
is converted to
     --filename  => 'string'

This function returns the argument name and the rule type. 

    my ($arg_name, $rule_type) = parse_short_rule($rule);
